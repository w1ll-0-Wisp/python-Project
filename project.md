# python-Project
the project is a random generator that saves to a list and exports a excel sheet


import random
low = 1
high = 20

number = random.randint(lowm high)

print(number)



# i want it to be a argparse so i can have the user roll for the dice









#the number should be put into a list then into a excel sheet to be exported, it does not delete the previous resaults and just adds more
